# Waypoint Guide 🚁

A compact embedded system that captures and displays a user's travel path. Built on an AVR microcontroller in Rust, this project interfaces with GPS, an SD card, and an LCD to log and visualize movement.
This project is based on an older embedded C project from 2019.

## Dependencies

- [AVR GCC Compiler](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/tools-resources/develop/microchip-studio/gcc-compilers)

## Features

- **Real-time GPS acquisition**: Interacts with a GPS module to obtain latitude, longitude, and timestamp data.
- **Route logging**: Writes continuous location data to an SD card, allowing offline storage and post-activity analysis.
- **Live path visualization**: Uses an LCD to present a simple UI showing current position, tracking stats, and a visual path map-marker.
- **Embedded firmware architecture**: Modular driver layers for GPS, SD card, and LCD, all managed by an AVR MCU using Embedded C for efficient performance.

## Project Architecture

```
🔐 GPS Driver   ➞  GPS Module
     └➞ Firmware Core (Embedded C) ➞ SD Card Interface
       └➞ LCD Driver ➞ LCD Display
                       ➞ SD Card Storage
```

- **GPS Driver**: Polls and parses NMEA sentences, extracts location and time.
- **SD Card Interface**: Handles logging packets of timestamped location data to external memory.
- **LCD UI**: Draws current position and path, intelligently scales/scrolls as the user moves.
- **MCU Logic**: Orchestrates hardware timing, driver coordination, and low-power handling when idle.

## Why This Matters

- **Practical embedded design**: Demonstrates full-stack development from low-level communication to user-facing display.
- **Hands-on sensor integration**: Covers interfacing real-world hardware: GPS, SD card, and LCD on AVR.
- **Portable utility**: Can be adapted for fitness, geocaching, navigation, or outdoor tracking.

## Todo

- Implement drivers (LCD, SD card, GPS)
- Implement OS logic
